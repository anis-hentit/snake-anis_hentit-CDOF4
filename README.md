# Python Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic snake game using Python and Pygame. Navigate the snake around the screen and try to eat the food. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen boundary or itself.

## Installation

To play the game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/anis-hentit/snake-anis_hentit-CDOF4.git
cd snake-game
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install Pygame, which is required to run the game.

## Running the Game

To run the game, navigate to the cloned repository directory and run the `main.py` script:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake:
  - `Up` arrow key to move up
